As a Mission Software Engineer for our Space team, you own the architecture and deployment of software solutions that support specific customer missions. You expand the meaning of ‘full stack developer’ as you touch backend and frontend cloud components as well as distributed edge compute and raw sensors. Some days you write code to add a mission-critical feature to an existing product. Some days you go to the field to coordinate real-world testing of your new feature with other supporting product teams. Some days everything works beautifully. Some days nothing works and you have to figure out what’s broken. As a mission capability evolves from crazy-idea to demo to pilot to program of record, you advance the software solution to deliver a real-world product. You will dive in to understand and then integrate with legacy systems that have been part of our nation’s critical defense for decades.

This role is directly tied to an ongoing, funded program within Anduril’s Space Business Line. The program requires building and fielding a resilient, software-defined, distributed mesh networking layer for critical Space Domain Awareness data.

As a Senior Mission Software Engineer for our Space team, you own the architecture and deployment of software solutions that support specific customer missions. You expand the meaning of ‘full stack developer’ as you touch backend and frontend cloud components as well as distributed edge compute and raw sensors. Some days you write code to add a mission-critical feature to an existing product. Some days you go to the field to coordinate real-world testing of your new feature with other supporting product teams. Some days everything works beautifully. Some days nothing works and you have to figure out what’s broken. As a mission capability evolves from crazy-idea to demo to pilot to program of record, you advance the software solution to deliver a real-world product. You will dive in to understand and then integrate with legacy systems that have been part of our nation’s critical defense for decades.

This role is directly tied to an ongoing, funded program within Anduril’s Space Business Line. The program requires building and fielding a resilient, software-defined, distributed mesh networking layer for critical Space Domain Awareness data. We work with mission partners and operators to deploy reliable and robust capabilities on operationally-relevant fielding timelines to meet complex challenges across the DOD and IC.

We are building a mission autonomy platform that is deployed on a variety of robotics platforms from high-end autonomous jets and large underwater autonomous vehicles through to smaller rotary wing aircraft, and everything in between. Every mission demands a different set of payloads, and our mission autonomy software must be flexible enough to allow users to build behaviors that make the best use of the specific sensors & payloads available.
  The three core components that compose our mission autonomy platform are a behavior tree execution framework, a motion planning library, and a tracking & fusion platform. Our users depend on our platform to achieve mission critical objectives in active conflict zones, and therefore every component is built from the ground up to be explainable, reliable, and resilient. As a senior software engineer, you will be responsible for interfacing with users (often Mission Software Engineers, but sometimes also Anduril’s end users) to understand problems, identifying & designing solutions to these problems, and implementing & delivering these solutions. The majority of our software is C++, and so solid experience in this language a must.
  Anduril is developing software at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and sensor fusion. As a tracking team, we are bringing together data from drones, cameras, radars, and many other sources into a single combined operational picture which enables users and autonomy to complete their missions. We develop cutting edge software for autonomous operation and situational awareness by having sensors and systems that work together to improve over time.

As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.
Lattice is the AI-powered sensor fusion network that underpins all Anduril products, enabling better real-time decision making. A collection of applications and services compose the platform: everything from sensor & data source ingestion & underlying environment setup, to user, sensor, and model configuration, to web-based operating pictures.

This role provides an opportunity for immediate impact on real-world operations. Our focus is on creating groundbreaking technology that operators need and trust, and all your work will feed into this. You will go deep to learn about gaps in existing defense capabilities, engage with users, synthesize feedback, and build the product infrastructure to support our goals. Anduril is a rapidly growing company, and the right person for this role should be able to work in partnership with engineers and designers, and thrive in a fast-paced environment with many competing priorities. You often will be expected to self direct, and to be comfortable navigating ambiguity. In the near-term, you will land on a Lattice team to solve specific challenges, but over time you will drive the evolution of the scope and focus of your role.

About You - You have experience in software product development and have taken something from a wild idea through a shipped solution. You have a thorough understanding of back-end web technologies & distributed systems, can engage deeply with engineers on architecture decisions, and can prioritize feature for both end-users and platform developers. You can turn conflicting or incomplete ideas into concrete action plans. Likewise, you can clearly say “No” when needed in order to cut through ambiguity. You’re excited about building a team to achieve ambitious goals, and bias towards action to help with any task that furthers this, whether that’s developing a demo, helping test a piece of hardware in the field, writing documentation, or QA'ing a new release.

You are curious and have a high rate of learning. Building an open, supportive, and inclusive company culture excites you, and you strive to provide honest feedback in service of this.


WHAT YOU'LL DO
Listen to developers. Lattice is a rapidly growing platform, supporting both internally and externally developed mission applications. You will learn about developer pain points, understand where those pain points reflect product deficiencies, and assess how those developer pain points are affecting end users.
Define solutions. Identify potential features that will accelerate Anduril’s goals, increase our ability to quickly scale, and create an excellent end user or developer experience. To do this, you will seek out real-world context in the form of onsite user research, internal expert feedback, existing product data, and industry tech investigation. You will capture core workflows and translate these user needs into well-scoped requirements and success hypotheses.
Prioritize and plan. Set clear outcomes for your portfolio in partnership with your engineering, design, and business partners. Develop team structures that allow prioritization of competing work within rapid development cycles. Help your team flex to adapt goals when needed, based on new information.
Communicate vision and execution strategy. Proactively communicate goals to stakeholders and manage expectations of delivery. Escalate large trade offs and necessary decision points as needed.
Execute. Work hands-on to deliver new capabilities across the lifecycle of the product, from initial release and onboarding, through day-to-day improvements. Validate and experiment along the way, acting as the voice of the user throughout.
When possible, lead with data. Define and monitor key metrics to measure success.
External storytelling. Work with business development, proposal, marketing, and compliance leads to communicate product capabilities externally. Participate in large-scale customer demos.
Build product culture. Develop relationships to bridge business and technical worlds. Build tech alongside prolific engineers and designers, and then zoom out to work with business development, operations, customer success, marketing, and finance teams in order to ensure success. Along the way, you’ll help define and drive product team culture and best practices.
  REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS
3 - 10 years in software product development, with at least 3 years specifically in a hands-on product management capacity
A deep understanding of back-end web technologies & distributed systems to consider capabilities and limitations

As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.
As a Business Operations Analyst, you will own the data that informs the operational decision making at Anduril. In this role, you will partner with leadership and teams from across the business — from our Tower and Drone teams to our field operations team to our customer success team — to unpack ambiguous problems and build lasting, scalable solutions. Your work will vary from quick-turn analytical problem solving to process and data improvements and building core dashboards and tables — all in the pursuit of helping grow how Anduril operates and measures itself.
  The Business Operations team at Anduril has two primary responsibilities:
  1) Standing up the operational processes and analytics to measure change. We work with teams to improve operational processes and building in the data-capture and analytics-reporting muscle to ensure changes for the long term.
2) Special projects. We are frequently pulled into high priority problems that must be solved, but do not fall neatly into the purview of an existing person’s job description. Our team is one of the first to get tapped when a messy problem needs solving.
  Much of the time, both of these go hand-in-hand.
  As a Business Operations Analyst, you will be critical to supporting both of these responsibilities. While the BizOps team will be your team, you will often be embedded in the business, working cross-functionally with leaders and teams throughout the organization to solve messy problems, set up new processes, capture data, action upon it, and enable others to do the same.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
Own operational projects end-to-end, from Definition, Solution, to Implementation. You will be handed ambiguous, messy problems with little prescription on how to solve them. If this does not excite you, this is not the role for you.
Work on operational problems involving the intersection of hardware and software systems. From inventory management systems, to asset-tracking in the field, to manufacturing systems capturing data on quality-issues on the production floor. Anduril is hardware business, and tracking hardware is messy. We need our systems, tools, and, processes to be up to the task.
Work deeply within data and systems, becoming intimately familiar with how our business systems (ERP, MRP, HRIS, etc.) function, and how to leverage data from them to create insights and analytics (leveraging tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau), equipping functional teams with these insights and tools to measure and improve their processes
Execute scrappy analyses on short-timelines to get answers quickly, while also owning more scalable solutions that will make Anduril successful in the long term
Project manage across many stakeholders. If you don’t like being the person leading meetings with large groups of people or managing large Slack channels to wrangle stakeholders towards a solution, this may not be the role for you
Work across functions and learn Anduril’s business top-to-bottom. You will interact with Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Finance, Engineering, HR, Recruiting, Growth, and more. The BizOps team is one of the most cross-functional teams at Anduril.
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS
You have 1+ years of experience in management consulting, investment banking, internal operations, or business analyst role
You lean into acknowledging your weaknesses and take the idea of feedback and growth seriously
You get energy from being a thought partner for others and it excites you to spend time translating operational problems into data problems, and to then going and executing on them
You are self-driven and relentlessly proactive. You don’t need someone to tell you to “move”. You just move. We’d rather have to tell you to slow down than to speed up.
You don’t wait on others to solve problems. You proactively step into the gap to offer solutions yourself.
You enjoy working at a place where no one minds if you leave early one day to go to an appointment or run an errand, but you also don’t mind responding to Slacks in the evening while you’re watching Netflix.
You have an appetite to build clear frameworks to structure problems.
You have strong analytical aptitude. You intuitively think about problems in terms of numbers and data-models, and you are able to quickly execute analyses in Excel or SQL.
You are comfortable communicating broadly and having a lot of eyes on your work. This role can at-times require comms to large groups and senior leadership. This should excite you!

Partner with other functional teams — specifically Information Security, Security Services, Business Systems, and Facilities — to drive deployment of infrastructure from inception to completion
Identify and develop tools and processes for continuously improving the intake, management, and execution of infrastructure requirements
Build the bridge between classified and unclassified environments so that engineering and administrative workflows are consistent and efficient when they need to exist on both sides

You love solving complex, ambiguous, cross-functional problems in a people-centric way

The Mission Autonomy (MA) Business Development (BD) team within the Air Dominance and Strike (AD&S) Division at Anduril is responsible for identifying, shaping, capturing, and growing new opportunities and capabilities to make Anduril the leading provider of Autonomy Software for DoD. BD team members serve as the bridge between clients and the broader Anduril team; they convey client perspectives to other teams across the enterprise while also serving as the Anduril brand ambassador externally. MA BD team members are given significant autonomy in job function to empower them to deliver the best Autonomy Software to the DoD. They partner extensively with the broader AD&S division team, to include engineering and program management, to ensure that Anduril products exceed client expectations and mission demands and to drive continuous product improvements in response to client needs.
Role overview

What You’ll Do
Generate and capture business opportunities.The BD team is ultimately responsible for growing revenue. Specifically, this role will focus on building business for Lattice for Mission Autonomy (MA) software. This is achieved by developing a deep understanding of the existing and prospective client base, knowing the current or planned programmatic and technical roadmaps, and being cognizant of the competitive landscape. This expertise will inform capture strategies, revenue forecasts, and aid in technology development plans. Tactically, you will manage continuous engagements with current and future clients, generate growth strategies, and monitor buying cycles for opportunities, lead specific proposals and new capture efforts, and close contracts that unlock new business for the business line. Specific emphasis will be placed on candidates with experience in engaging with US Air Force unmanned and autonomous platforms and weapons, and a focus on organizations within the Defense Innovation Ecosystem, such as DIU and AFWERX.
Grow existing business. You will partner with adjacent business lines and product engineers to grow business with current clients. This does not simply include expanding upon current work, but also leveraging existing partnerships to explore new areas of work or opportunities by sustaining and building upon the strong foundation of those client relationships.
Communicate our value to clients. BD team members represent Anduril to a broad audience: clients, partners, competitors, and the interested public. You must project the company’s ethos, conveying insights that illustrate our approach to building next-generation defense technology and our competitive edges in doing so. 
Inform product development.As you will often be the first Anduril employee to engage a client, you are charged with translating their problem set back into our engineering organization. The team must trust your value judgement and assessment of the required mission outcome as you interpret and convey various client needs.  Internally, you will provide the necessary clarity to inform priorities, keep Anduril stakeholders informed, determine key milestones, and proactively provide clear communications to appropriate levels of the company. Your assessment of clients’ needs will inform new product decisions, and your ongoing engagement with clients will yield crucial input that helps Anduril ensure our product suite is best-in-class.
What we’re looking for 
Demonstrated Software Sales Experience within DoD or the Commercial Sector. We're looking for a candidate who has effectively led and closed software sales, preferably related to autonomous platforms and weapons within DoD. Furthermore, as a supplier of autonomy software for first- and third-party platforms and weapons, we seek a candidate who understands the procurement behaviors, ecosystems, and processes of Prime Contractors, government program offices, and defense innovation organizations. Pre-existing relationships with these customer communities are expected.
Mission First Mindset. We put the needs of the mission and our clients first. We actively seek out opportunities to better understand our clients’ mission needs, with a goal to build the best possible products for the warfighter and radically evolve our national and international defense capabilities. We push ourselves and the limits of our capabilities in the pursuit of this goal.
Ownership Mentality.We’re looking for owners; those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance. We empower our individuals to quickly assume high levels of responsibility and entrust them to actively own their account and shape its success.
Technical Aptitude and Intellectual Curiosity.We are first and foremost a technology company, working at the leading edge of capabilities like machine learning, autonomy, distributed networking, and multi-modal sensor fusion. These capabilities form the foundation of our product offerings, so we are looking for those who are comfortable communicating technical concepts and can articulate them in the context of the client’s mission. Candidates with an engineering or technical background are strongly preferred.
Structured Thinker and Problem Solver. Leading technical programs requires clear communication and well-thought-out plans. We are looking for assertive communicators who bring a thoughtful perspective and honest dialogue. A solution-driven approach, the ability to distill complexity into its essential, digestible components, and the ability to supervise execution are critical to ensure mission success.
High Value Team Member. Do you enjoy working as part of a team? At Anduril, the path to success weaves through the organization - account teams, engineering, logistics, technical operations, and more. It requires humility, an eagerness to learn, and empathy toward your fellow team member. We assume best intentions and empathize with clients just as we do with our colleagues. Can you develop rapport at both the user and executive levels? Do you enjoy sharing successes? We are a low ego group that promotes teamwork and collaboration to bring about success.
360 Degree Leader. We are a flat, non-hierarchical organization with a largely matrix structure that is dynamic and evolving. We expect you to be self-aware enough to recognize your position of unstated leadership within the company. You should have a demonstrated ability to lead and influence people through both formal and informal constructs and in situations where there is lack of clarity across teams. Finally, we need people who identify gaps and breakdowns and solve them immediately, rather than point them out and step back. You should also seek 360 feedback to help inform your growth trajectory as a leader.
Diversity & Inclusion.Our mission is reshaping our world. And at the heart of our mission is our people. Their diversity is our strength. They reflect the world in which we do business and the communities in which we live. We celebrate diversity and welcome applications from people of all walks of life and encourage you to confidently share your unique experiences with us.

They partner extensively with the broader division team, to include engineering and program management, to ensure that Anduril products exceed client expectations and mission demands, and to drive continuous product improvements in response to client needs.


What You’ll Do:
Generate and capture SRM opportunities. The BD team is ultimately responsible for growing revenue. Specifically, this role will focus on building business for Anduril’s Rocket Motor Systems business line. Success will be achieved by developing a deep understanding of the existing and prospective customer base, knowing the current or planned programmatic and technical roadmaps, and being cognizant of the competitive landscape. This expertise will inform capture strategies and revenue forecasts and aid in technology development plans. Tactically, you will manage continuous engagements with current and future clients, generate growth strategies, monitor buying cycles for opportunities, lead specific proposals and capture efforts, and close contracts that unlock new business for the business line. Emphasis will be placed on candidates with experience in engaging US Air Force, Naval Aviation, and Army missiles communities.
Grow existing business. You will partner with execution teams and product engineers to grow business with current clients. This does not simply include expanding upon current work but also leveraging existing partnerships to explore new areas of work or opportunities by sustaining and building upon the strong foundation of those client relationships.
Communicate our value to clients. BD team members represent Anduril to a broad audience: clients, partners, competitors, and the interested public. You must project the company’s ethos, conveying insights that illustrate our approach to building next-generation defense technology and our competitive edges in doing so.
Inform product development. As you will often be the first Anduril employee to engage a client, you are charged with translating their problem setback into our engineering organization. The team must trust your value judgment and assessment of the required mission outcome as you interpret and convey various client needs. Internally, you will provide the necessary clarity to inform priorities, keep Anduril stakeholders informed, determine key milestones, and proactively provide clear communications to appropriate levels of the company. Your assessment of clients’ needs will inform new product decisions, and your ongoing engagement with clients will yield crucial input that helps Anduril ensure our product suite is best-in-class.
What we’re looking for:
Demonstrated Sales Experience in Weapons Systems or Solid Rocket Motors. We’re looking for a candidate who has effectively led and closed sales of weapons, missiles, or solid rocket motor systems. Furthermore, as an independent merchant supplier of solid rocket motors, we seek a candidate who understands the procurement behaviors, ecosystems, and processes of both Prime Contractors and government program offices. Pre-existing relationships with these customer communities are expected.
Mission First Mindset. We put the needs of the mission and our clients first. We actively seek out opportunities to better understand our clients’ mission needs, with a goal to build the best possible products for the warfighter and radically evolve our national and international defense capabilities. We push ourselves and the limits of our capabilities in the pursuit of this goal.
Ownership Mentality. We’re looking for owners; those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance. We empower individuals to quickly assume high levels of responsibility and entrust them to actively own their account and shape its success. The RMS BD team prides itself on the independence and autonomy that team members are given to identify opportunities, develop growth hypotheses, and execute their strategies.
Technical Aptitude and Intellectual Curiosity. We are, first and foremost, a technology company working at the leading edge of capabilities like machine learning, autonomy, and building autonomous air vehicles. Do you have a natural desire to see beyond simple cause and effect relationships to really understand how complex systems operate? Do you actively seek out opportunities to educate yourself? These capabilities form the foundation of our product offerings, so we are looking for those who are comfortable communicating technical concepts and can articulate them in the context of the client’s mission.
Structured Thinker and Problem Solver. Leading technical programs requires clear communication and well thought-out plans. We are looking for assertive communicators who bring a thoughtful perspective and honest dialogue. A solution-driven approach, the ability to distill complexity into its essential, digestible components, and the ability to supervise execution are critical to ensure mission success.
High-Value Team Member. Do you enjoy working as part of a team? At Anduril, the path to success weaves through the organization - account teams, engineering, logistics, technical operations, and more. It requires humility, an eagerness to learn, and empathy toward your fellow team members. We assume best intentions and empathize with clients just as we do with our colleagues. Can you develop rapport at both the user and executive levels? Do you enjoy sharing successes? We are a low-ego group that promotes teamwork and collaboration to bring about success.

Required Qualifications:
Ability to travel 50% required.
Prior experience in Defense Capture related to Missiles, Weapons Systems, or solid rocket motors.

Your work will vary from quick-turn analytical problem solving to process and data improvements and building core dashboards and tables — all in the pursuit of helping grow how Anduril operates and measures itself. Join us in helping increase the velocity of the organization by becoming an expert on our most critical workflows such as talent acquisition, people operations, benefits, compensation, and so much more.

WHAT YOU'LL DO:
You’ll both lead and help on critical projects for leaders in our People org, requiring you to quickly learn new subject matters and create priorities in an ambiguous situation.
You have an insanely high execution bar and will see projects through from conception to tactical completion to move Anduril forward.
You’ll use your qualitative and quantitative skill set to help design key analysis to influence and execute on operational decisions, and partner with analysts to execute.
Work deeply within data team and systems team, becoming intimately familiar with how our business systems (HRIS, etc.) function, and how to leverage data from them to create insights and analytics (leveraging tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau), equipping functional teams with these insights and tools to measure and improve their processes.
You’ll communicate across teams, bridging different parts of the organization to achieve cross-functional outcomes.
Own operational projects end-to-end, from Definition, Solution, to Implementation. You will be handed ambiguous, messy problems with little prescription on how to solve them.
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:
You have experience in management consulting, investment banking, internal operations, or business analyst role.
You are motivated by our mission. We are working to solve the biggest problems in defense.
You thrive in cross-functional projects that have a heavy combination of technical requirements and user-focused workflows.
You get energy from being a thought partner for others and it excites you to spend time creating process.
You are empathetic: you are eager to see the world from your users’ perspective.
You love solving complex, ambiguous, cross-functional problems in a people-centric way.
You’re both high ownership and low ego, approaching everything with strong outcome orientation and high humility.
You don’t wait on others to solve problems. You proactively step into the gap to offer solutions yourself.
You are comfortable communicating broadly and having a lot of eyes on your work. This role can at-times require communications to large groups and senior leadership. This should excite you!

As such, the technical writer will play a foundational role in setting the bar for tone, voice, and quality across our written artifacts.

With Anduril’s focus on defense and national security, user documentation plays a critical role in ensuring front-line operators know how to leverage the “arsenal of democracy.” Your mission is to make the process of learning how to operate systems as easy and seamless as possible, with exceptionally written and presented artifacts.

You will identify relevant stakeholders and lead them through a documentation roadmap with established key milestones and targets. This will require an in-depth understanding of what teams are relevant to documentation, and what an organized effort toward collaboration entails. You are to ensure that stakeholders are engaged at the right time, and you will guide them towards a finished user-facing document that plainly meets customer needs. Finally, you will work with our account teams to ensure that contract deliverables are accurate, on-time, and in the right format.

Written content artifacts under this charger may include things like: technical manuals, operational manuals, maintenance manuals, procedures, checklists, templates, user guides, troubleshooting guides, and release notes. You will partner with account, product, and engineering teams across all phases of product development to ensure users have the right documentation available.

Another critical aspect of this role is to build the infrastructure and tooling needed for creating and maintaining our documentation content at scale. This structure will enable technical writing contributions from elsewhere across the business. In this role, you will co-lead efforts to define requirements, identify software solutions, and then implement them while also building process and training to scale this function across other teams.

What you’ll do
Generate, review, and edit documentation that is user-focused. Work with engineering and operations to deliver task, conditions, standard-centric documentation
Contribute to Anduril’s technical writing toolkit - working on everything from style guides to the documentation lifecycle and review process, and also relevant software tool procurement through definition requirements for things like authoring and publishing tools
Evaluate and prioritize tasks required to successfully support product documentation efforts and keep them on track. Help drive the best decision for the company by using a data-driven approach and consider input from stakeholders to ensure well-informed decisions. You should be prepared to fill gaps that represent risks to the documentation roadmap
Communicate and help manage expectations. Ensure risks are noted with adequate time, mitigations are identified, and resources are allocated
Help build a culture of technical documentation by creating process and training for others to contribute content. Refine our product maturity framework so that documentation is a meaningful step towards productization of new systems.
  Required Qualifications
5+ years of demonstrated excellence generating technical documentation
Experience reading and interpreting engineering documentation
Experience building content in a variety of content authoring tools including word editors and specialized authoring software (e.g. Arbortext)
Strong communication (written and verbal) and interpersonal skills, with emphasis on technical subjects
Must thrive with autonomy and responsibility, managing competing priorities and tight deadlines. Impeccable project-management skills
Passion for excellent documentation and user experience
Must be eligible for Secret and higher security clearance (US)
  Preferred Qualifications
Experience writing technical user-facing documentation
Previous experience creating technical documentation in Aerospace and Defense (for DoD)
Military exposure and experience, particularly with military technical documentation writing and formatting standards, guidelines, and verbiage
Experience leading and managing teams on fast-paced, complex projects with multiple stakeholders

The Mission Operations (MOPs) team is responsible for managing the execution, growth, and success of our customer accounts. Working across product, engineering, sales, and logistics teams, our Mission Operations Engineers own the customer relationships and develop, plan, and deploy Anduril products in support of their missions. They work side-by-side with customers to understand their specific problem sets and then shape Anduril’s offerings alongside our engineering teams to fit the mission needs. Because the problems we solve are uniquely challenging, our Mission Operations Engineers naturally gravitate toward finding solutions and are adept at navigating organizational hurdles. They are ultimately responsible for customer and mission success and therefore play a critical role in the shaping and future of Anduril Industries.
  Command & Control is one of Anduril's Business Lines focused on building a next-gen software-defined distributed C2 architecture focused on orchestrating and automating 3rd party combat-fielded sensors and strike-networks for synchronized joint operations. We work with mission partners and operators to deploy reliable and robust capabilities on operationally-relevant fielding timelines to meet complex challenges across the DOD and IC.
  ROLE OVERVIEW
  Orchestrate the deployment of Anduril products. Lead the planning and deployment of Anduril’s flagship hardware and software products in support of customer missions. Through collaboration with our engineering, logistics, and technical operations teams, Mission Operators are in charge of deploying our products to the field, training end users, and ensuring the high performance of our products. We are obsessed about engagement and keeping our finger on the pulse of how customers interact with our products. This helps us improve the user experience and evolve their operational tactics and techniques. And if something isn’t quite right, we work with product teams to quickly address the issue on behalf of our customer.
  Grow your business through customer success. In addition to the operational and executive relationships you own, you will be responsible for meeting commercial targets that drive top line growth. This requires establishing committed and trust-based partnerships with our customers to not only help them solve their immediate problems, but also to foresee future opportunities where Anduril’s technology can make them more effective. Understanding Anduril’s value proposition and articulating how we can have an impact on a customer’s problem set, from the executive level to the end user, is critical to positioning Anduril for the future.
  Shape our products to meet mission needs. Work side-by-side with our customers to understand their specific mission challenges and represent the customer as you work with Anduril engineers to shape products that solve critical national and international security challenges. Anduril engineers rely on Mission Operators to understand the lay of the land and bring a perspective that informs the product development process.
  Collaborate across nearly every Anduril team. Successfully deploying our complex hardware and software products requires collaborating with nearly every internal Anduril team - business development, engineering, product, logistics, finance, legal, contracting, technical operations, and many more. You’ll be responsible for ensuring each party is engaged and informed, and will therefore become well-versed in what it takes to really bring the best of Anduril to our customers.
  WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
  Mission First Mindset. We put the needs of the mission and our customers first and understand that the US and its allies have no preordained right to victory in any future conflict. We actively seek out opportunities to better understand our customers’ mission needs, with a goal to build the best possible products for the warfighter and radically evolve our national and international defense capabilities. We push ourselves and the limits of our capabilities in the pursuit of this goal.
  Ownership Mentality. We’re looking for owners; those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance. We empower our Mission Operators to quickly assume high levels of responsibility and entrust them to actively own their account and shape its success. Our Mission Operators are just as comfortable helping to shape a proposal or pitch a new customer as they are working with engineers on new features or deploying products in the field.
  Technical Aptitude and Intellectual Curiosity. We are first and foremost a technology company, working at the leading edge of capabilities like machine learning, autonomy, distributed networking, and multi-modal sensor fusion. Do you have a natural desire to see beyond simple cause and effect relationships to really understand how complex systems operate? Do you actively seek out opportunities to educate yourself? These capabilities form the foundation of our product offerings, so we are looking for those who are comfortable communicating technical concepts and can articulate them in the context of the customer’s mission.
  Structured Thinker and Problem Solver. Leading technical programs requires clear communication and well thought-out plans. We are looking for assertive communicators who bring a thoughtful perspective and honest dialogue. A solution-driven approach, the ability to distill complexity into its essential, digestible components, and the ability to supervise execution are critical to ensure mission success.
  High Value Team Member. Do you enjoy working as part of a team? At Anduril, the path to success weaves through the organization - account teams, engineering, logistics, technical operations, and more. It requires humility, an eagerness to learn, and empathy toward your fellow team member. We assume best intentions and empathize with customers just as we do with our colleagues. Can you develop rapport at both the user and executive levels? Do you enjoy sharing successes? We are a low ego group that promotes teamwork and collaboration to bring about success.
  360 Degree Leader. We are a flat, non-hierarchical organization with a matrix structure that is dynamic and evolving. We expect you to be self-aware enough to recognize your position of unstated leadership within the company. You should have a demonstrated ability to lead and influence people through both formal and informal constructs and in situations where there is lack of clarity across teams. Finally, we need people who identify gaps and breakdowns and solve them immediately, rather than point them out and step back. You should also seek 360 feedback to help inform your growth trajectory as a leader.
  Diversity & Inclusion. Our mission is reshaping our world. And at the heart of our mission is our people. Their diversity is our strength. They reflect the world in which we do business and the communities in which we live. We celebrate diversity and welcome applications from people of all walks of life, and encourage you to confidently share your unique experiences with us.
